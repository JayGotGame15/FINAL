  <h1>This is my high school Varsity Team</h1>

<p>this photo was last year 2017-18. My sophmore year things were tuff but with the coaches I
 have they make sure you work for everything you want to achieve. This is like a thank you page, a thank you to the coaches I  have.
For being here with me even though I  made my mistakes. They make sure I'm fine. They push me and push to become a top player and a leader for my team.
Being at west with these guys was fun but even then coach made sure we didn't have to much fun. He told us all the time "having fun is ok but you have to remember what's most important."
coaches aren't fathers but they are there. But anyway I'm so happy to have the coaches I do. </p>
