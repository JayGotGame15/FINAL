<h2>Summery</h2>
<hr></hr>
<p>Took one term of java script. Learning how to code and create web sites.
doing a search bar, learning how to put pictures in codes. I've Trained to work on cars oil, changes,
 change tire, take off tire, take pressure of air in tire,
 and how to tell dates of things on the care. I've taken wood tech classes my freshman year so I know names of saw's and other tools.
    I know how to do things like measuring the wood what type of wood to use and other things of that category.
    Many things in the class could've caused an accident and that would've been tarrible.
     So we were very careful without making any mistakes.
    My teacher's name was Mr. Lightner he was only my teacher once for my sophmore year Having him was a pleasure.   </p>
